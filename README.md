# HEAT EQUATION SOLVER FOR UNSTEADY INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

This project is a solver for the Navier-Stokes model in the case of 2D incompressible flows. Since the thermal and dynamic aspects of the flow are separable (see incompressible Navier-Stokes equations below), the code first computes the motion, and then solves the heat equation using the known motion.

The computation of the fluid motion is performed by explicitely integrating the velocity first, and then updating the pressure field by solving a linear system AX = B. The matricial system is solved with a LU decomposition LUX = B, thanks to the Doolittle Algorithm.

Then, the computed motion is used in a Î¸-scheme along with the Gauss-Seidel algorithm to solve the resulting linear system for the temporal integration of the energy equation.

This project is coded as a C++ library interfaced with Python scripts, to benefit from the performance of the C++, the flexibility of Python and the graphical rendering of the Matplotlib library. The interface is realized with the PyBind11 library.

## Requirements
To compile the library :
- CMake  
- A C++ compiler  
- The PyBind11 library  

To use it with Python :
- Python 3+  
- The Numpy and Matplotlib libraries  

## How to install
Go to the code directory and execute the following commands to create a build directory to compile the library, a data directory to store the raw simulation outputs, and a results directory to save the postprocessed results.
```console
user@linux:~/path/to/code$ mkdir build  
user@linux:~/path/to/code$ mkdir data  
user@linux:~/path/to/code$ mkdir results  
```

Execute the following commands to compile the C++ library.
```console
user@linux:~/path/to/code$ cd build  
user@linux:~/path/to/code/build$ cmake ../src -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install    
user@linux:~/path/to/code/build$ make install    
```

## How to use
Execute these commands to get to the python directory and add the library to the PYTHONPATH.
```console
user@linux:~/path/to/code$ cd python
user@linux:~/path/to/code/python$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/../build/install/lib/python
```

For each simulation, follow these steps :
- edit the parameters.py file
- execute the simulation.py file
- execute the plot.py file
